# SlowFood Weekend Challenge

## Week 5
- Create application from scratch
- Restaurant/food domain
- Build an online food ordering system
- Building a SaaS (Software as a Service) application serves several purposes.
- Understand how basic eCommerce applications work.
- Learn  how to use the AGILE mindset.
- Incremental: adding new functionality in small chunks.
- Iterative: performing repeatedly, i.e. adding new functionality in a repetitive or cyclic manner. (i.e. we add small things on a regular basis - we add complexity around the core functionality).
- Agile core principles: * Focus on the user needs. * Deliver iteratively. * Keep improving how your team works. * Fail fast and learn quickly. (Better to scratch and start again unless you have dug yourself too deep). * Keep planning and stick to your plan.
- Building user inferfaces
- Deployment flow: - Rails - Heroku - Semifor (service used to make sure that everything merged into a code place works). - Ruby - Coveralls (test coverage metrics) - SendGrid - Codeacy (make sure code quality is high)
- Automated flow: as soon as an update is done; Heroku will update your platform continuosly.

## Rules
- The entire week including the weekend.
- Code quality, originality of design and functionality.
