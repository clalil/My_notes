# Agile and Scrum introduction  

## Introduction   
 Software development has been around since the 60's.  
 We sent people to the moon with a fraction of the code  
 that we use today. Programmers used to be treated like  
 scientists because they were like scientistis.  

 [The manifesto for Agile Software Development](https://agilemanifesto.org/):  
 * Individuals and interactions > process and tools  
 * Working software > comprehensive documentation  
 * Customer collaboration > contract negotiation  
 * Responding to change > following a plan  
**i.e. while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.**  

### Main principles  
* The highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.  
* Preference to the shorter timescale when it comes to deliver working software frequently.  
* Working software is the primary measure of progress.  

The agile way is a way to avoid mistakes and misunderstandings that may delay the product deployment in the future. I.e. it doesn'y bring any value to the client if you worked on something for two days that in the end only worked at home but not at production.  

## Agile == an approach that embraces change  
An agile approach puts the customer first - we want to develop software because we want to create code that satisfies our customers.  

The agile approach is also a business oriented approach where we work together with the business people on a day to day basis. There needs to be constant communication. Which can be hard because us programmers have to be able to zoom into our code while still understanding why we are doing something. This is a people orientend approach.  

The manifesto was created 20 years ago - hence the geographical bridge gap that they mentioned back then is no longer an issue due to different online communication tools. Hence the face-to-face conversation does not have to be equal to seeing one another in the very same place.  

## Agile - a learning oriented approach  
* Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.  
* The best solutions comes from self-organizing teams.  
* We as developers need to communicate with other people close to the production line so that we can capture their true needs and deliver the correct product. Hence the need to continuously reflect on how the team can perform better next time, like a BC retrospect. I.e. "What works - what doesn't?".  

In order to practice Agile we need a set of rules:  
* Doing agile (adhering to rules) vs being agile (having a different mindset - i.e. answering a question that is not very well forumlated).    
* Agile is like going through one door only to discover ten new doors behind that one door.  
* An agile mindset is an aquired skill! Instead of following a checklist (a pre-defined path) we need to widen our horizon.  

## Scrum  
Scrum == an agile framework built upon the agile ideas. It is regarded as an easy framework but not easy to use. #### Roles: ScrumMaster, Product Owner and Scrum Team (Development team)  
**Artifacts:  
- Product Backlog (a bucketlist for all the requirements).  
- Sprint backlog (a subset of the product backlog that you focus on in a specific sprint i.e. "create account", "append permit" etc).  
- Burndown chart (a chart that indicates how much work is remaining in the sprint).  
* Time boxes:  
Daily scum meeting (15 minute check-in where every developer checks in and updates the team on blockers, progress and future plans during the day).  

* Sprints:  
A short meeting (7-14 days) where every sprint ends with a retrospective (review, commitment and planning and retrospective meeting).  

### XP (Extreme programming)  
XP == Extreme Programming  
It supplements Scrum process with practices like:  
- BDD  
- TDD  
- Pair programming  
- Automated tests == best way to make sure software does and performs the way we wish it to  
- Refactoring is a good practice (refactor working features)  
- Code reviews (collective code ownership i.e. all programmers on the team should know everyone's code instead of saying 'I don't know what this code does').  
- Continuous integration and deployment  
All this leverages the popularity of Scrum with the sound engineering practices of XP.  

# Software Craftmanship  
### Is an extension of the Agile Manifesto  
well-crafted software > working software  
steadily adding value > responding to change  
community of professionals > individual & interactions  
productive partnership > customer collaboration  
**Emphazize the coding skills of the software developers themselves.**  

- Mastering the art of software development is hard, and experience is the only teacher of value:  
* Coding Katas [Hackerrank](https://www.hackerrank.com) & [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)  
* Coding Dojo (group exercises that has the purpose of spreading knowledge amongst the members of the audience).  
* Coderetreat (A weekend or few days during the week)  
* Coders A.B.C - always be coding!! (i.e. w/o putting too much pressure on yourself, you should be able to code on side projects or KATAs when your team mates are gone - if you have devoted the time to code, then you should code during that time and not take time off it.)  

**We strive for excellence in every step - make every day count towards our progress**  

**Writing code is only part of our job description - nothing absolves us from common sense. Saying no to things is extremely important.**
