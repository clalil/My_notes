# React Advanced  
## Prerequisites  
- Basic knowledge of React JS, JS, of the DOM, Familiarity of ES6, Node.js and npm installed globally.
- BMI Challenge (testing w. jest, enzyme and cypress).
- Cooper Challenge (BDD and TDD driven development in React).
- Build our own API this week (interacting with back-end).
- Important to understand how a client talks with the backend and what part the client is in the MVC pattern.
- MC in the back end and client is the view.
- Use SemanticUI for Reacy, use the project as a "KitchenSink" for experimenting with React.
- More advanced usage of stateful/stateless components.
- Interaction with API (getting and writing data).
- Manage state - Introduction to redux.
- Testing (unit/component tests and integration tests).
## Testing
- Acceptance test (is the application doing what we want it to do?)
- Component test (are each individual component doing what we expect).
- BMI Challenge: simple logic. 
- Copper test challenge: back-end; does it matter? Client in React, back-end in Rails. Testing fetched data from API.
- Now it's time to learn how to 'think in React'.
