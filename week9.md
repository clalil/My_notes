* onBlur = if you click somewhere else on the screen, the input field is not in focus, then it is blurred out and changes the state.  

## Image upload

# Continuation Redux
```js

<Provider store={store}>
<App/>
</Provider>
//the redux wrapper around the app co,poment
//Reducer (only does one single thing for us): only returns the initial state!

window.store.getState() //returns the initial state from the store that we get from Redux.

//App component
import { connect } from 'react-redux'

class App... {
  state = {
    greeting: 'Hello World form Component State'
  }

  render() {
    <>
    <h1>{this.state.greeting}</h1>

    The actual redux state-->

    state: state
  }
  //we want it to return the state object, i.e. we could say:
  greeting: state.greeting
}
//here state has an attribute of greeting

export default connect(mapStateToProps)(App);

//connects the component to the redux store. We want to pass in a function to the connect, by convention it is called mapStateToProps; it will be called every time the redux store changes. It receives the entire store state.

//the connect function takrs a  few arguments, the firsy one is mapStateToProps

//create a completely new component

class AppNew... {
  render() {
    <>
  <Greeting {`${this.props.from} to {this.props.to}: {this.props.content}`}/>

    })}>Change greeting
    </button>

  //dispatch an object with two properties, type and a payload (second argument; could be "greeting"). Type is obligatory. It dispatches an action. Now we need to modify our reducer to accept this argument.
}

export default connect()(Form);

//only dispatches an action hence do not need mapStateToProps here.

//go to root reducer, allow it to take another argument called "action" (naming convention for second argument)
//(first argument is currently initialState)

const rootReducer = (state = initialState, action => {
  return state
})
//here the action would be the object we sent off from Form component

if (action.type === 'CHANGE_GREETING') {
  return {
    ...state, greeting: action.payload
  }
} else {
  return state
}
//we are not modifying the state itself but instead create a new object with its greeting modified. The state is immutable hence we cannot change it inside of the rootReducer.

//mapStateToProps can be thought of as compared with the setState function when we set state to the components.

//multiple reducers in your applications where the root reducer imports your secondary reducers (combinedReducers function) and combine them into one; is to deal with more complex state and actions i.e. if we had a simple reducer as well as one for redux token auth.

//You can also wrap your dispatches in functions so that you can re-use them to keep your code DRY.

//asynchronous calls on reducers and extend using 'func' is a more advanced concept but can be used f.eks. when incorporating fetching data from external APIs.

//navigator = the browser; you're navigator object. it has an attribute called geolocation
//navigator.geolocation
//we can call on this in our browser using:
navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(location => {
  console.log(location.coords)
})

# Amazon Webservices (Image attachment part 3)
```js
//Heroku does not give us the functionality to store images, that is why we need to store them on the cloud service (Amazon webservice bucket)

>$ 
```

```rb
#Add gem
gem 'aws-sdk-s3'

#Go into config, development.rb fÃ¶r from local: config.active_storage.service = :amazon

#Go into production.rb:
config.active_storage.service = :amazon

#Add credentials to amazon through storage.yaml, uncomment amazon:
amazon:
#Copy and add exact but header
#(amazon_production and development are only used if you actually go to production)

EDITOR="code --wait"...
#Add to credentials:
aws:
 access_key_id: fwawhahw
 secret_access_key: shakfja
(we get keys)

#AWS console is hard to set up...but you can host a lot of SaaS services. We will only use storage services, called S3. They use a concept of "buckets", which is basically a container.

#every item using active storage as a hash..usually the images are not public but accessed through a publication.

#we get a bucket name
#region: eu-north-1 (region)
#bucket: fake-news-development

#in storage, change to
..aws[:access_key_id]
..aws[:secret_access_key]

>PRY: @article.image.service_url
should in PRY show us the actual url to our amazon picture

#index serialiser:
attr: , :image

def image
if Rails.env.test?
 rails_blob_url(object.image)
 else
 object&.image&.service_url(expires_in: 1.hour, disposition: 'inline')
end

#destroy Articles w/o images in rails c it also deletes amazon webbucket as well


```
```js
//Heroku does not give us the functionality to store images, that is why we need to store them on the cloud service (Amazon webservice bucket)

//src ListArtciles
//debugging the response now contains an image to our url on amazon

//Add:
<img src={article.image}/>
//Ta-da!
//We need to refresh the page as the "indexupdated" just like in cooper challenge, otherwise you need to reload the page.
```
